# Transducer-RNN-LM

Pretrained Transducer RNN for language model.

**This directory is very lack of comments, able to understand Tensorflow, Tensorflow estimator, Tensorflow Dataset is really helpful**.

## how-to

1. Run training notebook, 

BASE size, [pretrained-transducer-rnn-base.ipynb](pretrained-transducer-rnn-base.ipynb).
