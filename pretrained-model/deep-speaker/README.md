# Speaker Vector

Trained on Librispeech, https://github.com/philipperemy/deep-speaker

**This directory is very lack of comments, understand Tensorflow, Tensorflow estimator, Tensorflow Dataset really helpful**.

## How-to

1. Change from Keras checkpoint to Tensorflow, run [export-to-tf.ipynb](export-to-tf.ipynb).

2. Load generated Tensorflow checkpoints and run prediction, [deep-speaker-tf.ipynb](deep-speaker-tf.ipynb).

3. Freeze the models for production, [export-deep-speaker.ipynb](export-deep-speaker.ipynb).
