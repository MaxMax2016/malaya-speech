# SpeakerNet

Exported from NEMO, https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/speaker_recognition/Speaker_Recognition_Verification.ipynb, considered the best speaker verification model.

**This directory is very lack of comments, able to understand Tensorflow, Tensorflow estimator and Tensorflow Dataset are really helpful**.

## How-to

1. Change from Pytorch checkpoint to Tensorflow, run [export-pytorch-to-tf.ipynb](export-pytorch-to-tf.ipynb).

2. Freeze the models for production, [export-speakernet.ipynb](export-speakernet.ipynb).
