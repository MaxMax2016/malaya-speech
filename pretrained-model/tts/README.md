# Text to Speech

Pretrained Malaya Speech TTS models.

**This directory is very lack of comments, able to understand Tensorflow, Tensorflow estimator and Tensorflow Dataset are really helpful**.

## how-to

1. Download and dataset, 

For Male speaker, [../prepare-tts/preprocess-male.ipynb](../prepare-tts/preprocess-male.ipynb).

For Female speaker, [../prepare-tts/preprocess-female.ipynb](../prepare-tts/preprocess-female.ipynb).

For Husein speaker, [../prepare-tts/preprocess-husein.ipynb](../prepare-tts/preprocess-husein.ipynb).

2. Split train and test,

For Male speaker, [../prepare-tts/train-test-tts-male.ipynb](../prepare-tts/train-test-tts-male.ipynb).

For Female speaker, [../prepare-tts/train-test-tts-female.ipynb](../prepare-tts/train-test-tts-female.ipynb).

3. Follow README inside model directory, example, [tacotron2](tacotron2).
