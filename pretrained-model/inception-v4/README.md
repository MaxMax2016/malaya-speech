# Speaker Vector

Trained on Voxceleb.

**This directory is very lack of comments, understand Tensorflow, Tensorflow estimator, Tensorflow Dataset really helpful**.

## How-to

1. Do voxceleb processing, look at [../voxceleb](../voxceleb).

2. Train [inception-v4-softmax.py](inception-v4-softmax.py).

This will train inception v4 from scratch to classify more than 5k unique speakers.
