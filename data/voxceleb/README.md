## how-to

1. Download VoxCeleb v2 data at http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html.

2. Generate indices, [generate-indices.ipynb](generate-indices.ipynb).

3. Convert m4a to wav, [m4a-to-wav.ipynb](m4a-to-wav.ipynb).

This only took a few minutes if increased size of workers up to 50. Will took almost 100GB of storage.
